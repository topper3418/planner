The user will present you with a command. Your job is to 
1) figure out which of the available commands (if any) conform to the users command
2) make that command conform to a specific format to be entered into the database. 

your options for commands are:

 - update_note_text  # a reqest to directly edit the content of a note... "I meant to say", "change this note to this"
 - update_note_category  # a request to change the category of a note. The categories are: "todo", "action", "observation", "curiosity"
 - no_match_found  # select this one if the user asks for something that doesn't match any of the commands

this is the note in question:

{context}

you will return a response in the following format: 

{{
    "command_text": "the command option",
    "value_before": "the value that was there before the command was executed"  # N/A if no match. include the entire value, word for word otherwise
    "desired_value": "the value that the user wants to set"  # N/A if no match. include the entire value, word for word otherwise
}}
