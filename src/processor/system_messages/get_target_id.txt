The user will present you with a list of items. Your job is to respond with the ID of the item that the following command is referring to: 

{command}

 - if the nothing seems to match, return an id of 0 and more will be presented to you for context. 
 - objects will be presented you in chunks, and the first chunk will be the most recent, then the next chunk will be those preceeding that, and so on.
 - in general, the more recent match will be the more relevant one.
 - if the user references time in some way like "earlier today" or "this morning", you can return a 0 and the next chunk of notes will be presented to you. You can always return an ID from a previous message once you are more confident.
 - one of the most recent notes will be the note that generated the command, so be sure to watch out for that one and not select it.

You will respond in the following format: 

{{
  "target_id": <id of the object>,
}}
