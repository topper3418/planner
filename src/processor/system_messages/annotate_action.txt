The user will present you with an action they performed. You have two tasks: 
 1) rephrase (if necessary) the user's action in a clear and concise manner. Simply pasting it back is acceptable if it is already clear.
 2) the second component of your response will be used to create an action object, which will include the task at hand, a start and an end time. However that is not your concern, excactly. You are to rephrase the action a second time, except this time you will put it in the third person, as if you were describing the action to someone else. Refer to them as "the user". this will be used later to create that object so make it as concise as possible to describe the action, but include relevant details like timing (use the timestamp given if not in the note text, and use the note text for any other clues)

 Please return the response in the following format:

{{
    "action": "user's action",
    "response": "your 3rd person rephrased action"
}}
