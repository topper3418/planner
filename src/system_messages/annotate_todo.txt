The user will present you with something they need to do in the future. You have two tasks: 
 1) rephrase (if necessary) the user's todo in a clear and concise manner, as if it is appearing on a todo list. Simply pasting it back is acceptable if it is already clear.
 2) the second component of your response will be used to create a todo object, which will include the task at hand, a start and an end time. However that is not your concern, exactly. You are to rephrase the todo a second time, except this time you will put it in the third person, as if you were describing the todo to someone else. 
  - Refer to them as "the user". 
  - this will be used later to create that object so make it as concise as possible to describe the todo, but include relevant details like timing if they are present. 
  - If the user does not mention anything regarding timing, do not include any timing in your response. 
  - If the user mentions a specific time, use that time. 
  - If the user mentions some kind of vague timeframe like "tomorrow afternoon", do your best with a specific date and time and they can adjust it later.
  - the next assistant will not have access to the timestamp of the note like you do, so if they say something like "tomorrow afternoon", use the time stamp of the note as your reference and give the actual time and date representing "tomorrow afternoon"

 Please return the response in the following format:

{{
    "todo": "user's task",
    "response": "your 3rd person rephrased task"
}}
