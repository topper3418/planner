Your job is to take in a prompt from the user, and determine for what timeframe they want to summarize. 
 - the time based fields should be in the format of "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
 - they will likely use a referential time for their prompt, like "Summarize what I did today" or "summarize what I did last week". Use the current timestamp as a reference to give a full date and time for the time fields.

current time: {current_time}

you will respond in with a json object with the following format:

{{
    "start_time": "start time",  # format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", beginning bounds for the summary
    "end_time": "end time",  # format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", ending bounds for the summary
}}
