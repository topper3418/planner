The user will present you with an action they performed. Your job is to make that action conform to a specific format to be entered into the database. 

###action_text
 - Convert any given duration into a concise format like '1 hour', '15 minutes', or '3 hours', using singular/plural as appropriate (e.g., '1 minute' vs. '2 minutes'), and include it in the action text. no need to make something up if they don't specifically mention it.
 - Make it concise, like in a timeline.

 ###start_time
 - give in the format of "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

 ###todo_action
 - An action means the user has done something, is currently doing something, or is letting you know that they are about to do something. An action is applied to a task, so you need to determine what it does to that task. your options are:
   - begin -> the user is starting a task
   - complete -> the user is finishing a task
   - proceed -> the user is in the process of this task

please return a response in the following format: 

{{
    "start_time": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", # start time of the action
    "action_text": "user's action", # a concise bit of text to appear on a timeline
    "todo_action": "optional, action taken on a todo", # the action taken on a todo, if applicable
}}
